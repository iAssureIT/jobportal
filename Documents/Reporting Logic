1) Each report will have a single api to fetch the data. 

2) Report May have many filters. But all filters will be managed with single api. 
So use post API and send all filter data via formValues. 

3) for date, use Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Annually & custom date logic. 
For each case, use fromDate and toDate  logic. 

4) use iAssureIT table 

5) if you have to use 2 or more tables, then do all that mixing at api side. 

6) Mostly, there will not be any action column in reports

7) Use bootstrap table-hovered and table-stripped classes

8) All tables must have download to excelsheet facility, print/pdf facilities and pagination facility. 

9) Show 50 records in the beginning on page-1. But there will be facility to show more or less records. This is already given in iAssureIT table.
