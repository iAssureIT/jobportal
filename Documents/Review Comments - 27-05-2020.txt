2) Leftside menu bar for Admin
	- All bookings   (Add "s")
	- Date field is unnecessarily long. Make it short enough to occupy date. Not more than that. 
	  Also rename Custom tab as => "Date Range"
	  From and To Fields need to be shorten just to occupy date value. 
	  Remove Sr No column. 
	  
	- Move Vendor Mapping to Vendor menu
	- Remove Bulk upload menu.. Move all items to individual forms. change singlefield Master form. Add toggle button on top right like =>    Manual Form | Bulk Upload
	Manage this field from Props. If prop is true then only show. 

	- Make a single page of Master data. It must have looks same as Global Masters. No need to use Tabs. Each tab like button will have a separate url. This structure will bring all masters to single page. 

	-  When two field master is used, show the first field master link on the same form using Plus sign. 
	  All two fields masters like Brand/Model or Document List/Document Entity, etc. 

	- Rename To => Vehicle Category & Designation Mapping
